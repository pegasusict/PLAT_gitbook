**Short Introduction:**

Pegasus' Linux Administration Tools is a suite of scripts which help with tedious repetitive tasks which make up a large portion of Linux administration. Most of these scripts are contained individually or as a group within their own subprojects except for postinstall/maintenance:

 * Pegasus' Bash Function Library or PBFL for short, consists of a group of scripts. Each script holds functions which are aimed at a particular task, external program or API. 

 * PLAT/WordPress Tools is a toolset aimed at setting up, migrating and maintaining production/development websites powered by WordPress.

 * PLAT/apt cacher is a set of scripts to install and configure both clients and servers in conjunction with apt-cacher-ng

 * PLAT/Container Toolset is a toolset to install/maintain LXC/LXD containers

 * PLAT/Internet watchdog is a script which monitors the connection with the external DNS servers. If it fails, our ISP has had another hickup and the network stack needs to be re-initialized which will be done automatically.
